Circuits used for the tensor network simulation challenge organised by Pablo Andres-Martinez in May-July 2025. More detail about the circuits and the scripts to generate them can be found at https://github.com/CQCL/tn_sim_challenge_circuits.

Three circuits are missing since they were too large to upload to GitHub: 
circ_128_mean_dict.json
uccsd_sto3g_H2SO4.json
uccsd_sto3g_C4H8.json
