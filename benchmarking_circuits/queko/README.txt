A collection of random QUEKO circuits. These circuit are design to have a known optimal depth. In the case of circuits in this suite:
	 - The number of qubits ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
	 - The number of layers ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
	 - Circuits are generated either for the heavy hexegon or a square grid architecture.
