A collection of random QUEKO circuits. These circuit are design to have a known optimal depth on particular architectures.
In the case of circuits in this suite:
	 - The number of qubits ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
	 - The number of layers ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
	 - Heavy hexagon circuit are generated on 4x4 heavy hexagon architectures.
	 - Square grid circuits are generated on 4x4 square grid architectures.
