A collection of circuits containing random Pauli gadgets. A Pauli gadget with a random set of Pauli operators in the exponential constitutes one layer. This is repeated for several layers.

In the case of circuits in this suite:
	 - The number of qubits ranges from 2 to 56 in increments of 3.
	 - The number of layers ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
