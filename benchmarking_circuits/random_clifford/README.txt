A collection of uniformly sampled random Clifford circuits.

- The number of qubits ranges from 4 to 52 in increments of 4.
- Each qubit count has 20 circuits.
- Circuit names follow the format 'cliff_{n qubit}_{index}'.

The circuits were generated using the `random_clifford_circ` method in Qermit 0.5.0 with the seed set to 0.
