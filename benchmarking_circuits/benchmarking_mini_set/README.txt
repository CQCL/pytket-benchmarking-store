A collection of 62 circuits sampled from four different suites: IBM Classic, Pauli Gadget, Quantum Volume, and UCC Hamiltonian.

IBM Classic (20 circuits):
     - Each circuit contains fewer than 1000 2-qubit gates.

Pauli Gadget (18 circuits):
     - The number of qubits ranges from 5 to 56 in increments of 3.
     - Each circuit consists of 11 layers of PauliExpBoxes.

Quantum Volume (18 circuits):
     - The number of qubits ranges from 5 to 56 in increments of 3.
     - Each circuit consists of 11 layers of Unitary2qBoxes.

UCC Hamiltonian (10 circuits):
     - Six 10-qubit circuits and four 12-qubit circuits.
     - The number of 2-qubit gates ranges from ~1000 to ~8000.
