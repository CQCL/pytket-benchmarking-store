A collection of random IQP circuits. Each layer consists of CZ gates along the edges of random connected graphs with maximum degree three. In the case of circuits in this suite:
	 - The number of qubits ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
	 - The number of layers ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
