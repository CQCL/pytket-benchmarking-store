A collection of random QAOA circuits. Each layer consists of a cost term and a mixing term. Both are random hamiltonians acter for a random period of time. The hamiltonians are the same between layers, but the times they act for are randomly asigned.In the case of circuits in this suite:
	 - The number of qubits ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
	 - The number of layers ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
