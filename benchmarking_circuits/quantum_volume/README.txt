A collection of random circuits, inspired by those used during Quantum Volume experiment. Haar random SU4 gates act on pairs of qubits in a random bipartition of the qubits in the circuit. This is repeared for several layers.

In the case of circuits in this suite:
	 - The number of qubits ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.
	 - The number of layers ranges from 2 to 20 in increments of 3.

See the paper 'Validating quantum computers using randomized model circuits' for more details.
