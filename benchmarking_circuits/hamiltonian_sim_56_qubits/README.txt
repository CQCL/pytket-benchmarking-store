Circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quench dynamics on 2D lattices. 

- All of them use 56 qubits.
- They are in the gateset {Rz, Rx, ZZPhase, XXPhase}.
- They are 2D lattices with periodic boundaries. Lattices are either square or honeycomb.
- Two models: TFIM (Transverse-Field Ising Model) and ZX (XY-model with basis changed).
- The Hamiltonian simulation uses 2nd order Trotter steps.
- The model, lattice and value of the quench variables are given in the name of the circuit.
